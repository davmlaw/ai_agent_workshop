# CLAUDE.md

Conventions for the `mytools` project. This is copied to the repo root during setup
and read automatically at the start of every session — edit it as your design firms up,
either directly or with the `#` prefix from inside a session.

## My fork — fill this in first

**My fork is `davmlaw/ai_agent_workshop`.**

Anything that **creates** — `gh issue create`, `gh pr create` — passes
`--repo davmlaw/ai_agent_workshop`. Never write to
`SACGF/ai_agent_workshop`: that's the shared upstream template and thirty other people
are working from it.

Reading and reviewing someone else's PR is fine when I name their fork explicitly
(`gh pr diff`, `gh pr review --repo <partner>/ai_agent_workshop`). The rule is about
where new things land, not about what you're allowed to look at.

Pass the flag every time. `gh` with a missing or empty `--repo` does not fail — it
silently resolves to the git remote and exits 0, so a forgotten flag looks exactly like
a success.

## What this is

`mytools` is a small reimplementation of a subset of bedtools: `sort`, `merge`,
`intersect`, `subtract`, `closest`. Real `bedtools` is installed and is the oracle —
if our output differs from it on the same input, we are wrong.

## Interval semantics — read this before touching overlap logic

BED is **0-based, half-open**. `chr1 100 200` covers bases 100..199. Therefore:

- Two intervals overlap iff `a.start < b.end AND b.start < a.end`. Note strict `<`.
- Bookended intervals (`a.end == b.start`) do **not** overlap. They do merge under
  `merge -d 0`.
- Zero-length intervals (`start == end`) are legal in our fixtures and bedtools
  handles them in ways you will not guess. Do not "fix" them — match the oracle.

Every off-by-one bug in this project lives in that comparison. When a golden test
fails, look there first.

## Testing

- `./tests/run_golden.sh` diffs every subcommand against real bedtools on `data/`.
  It does not exist yet — `tests/README.md` has the worked example to build it from.
- **Run it before every commit.** It takes seconds; there is no excuse.
- Fixtures are `data/a.bed`, `data/b.bed` (edge cases) and `data/genes.bed`.
  Do not regenerate or "tidy" them — the edge cases are deliberate.
- New subcommand or flag? Add its golden case in the same commit.
- Unit tests live in `tests/` too and must run without bedtools. One per edge case:
  bookended, zero-length, nested, position 0, and the overlap predicate itself.
- Fixed a failing golden test? Add the unit test that would have caught it first.
- If bedtools does something surprising, the test encodes bedtools' behaviour.
  Add a comment saying why; do not encode what you think it should do.

## Code

- Prefer streaming I/O. Read line by line, write as you go. `sort` is the one
  command allowed to hold a chromosome in memory.
- Read from a file argument or stdin (`-` means stdin).
- Errors go to stderr, never stdout — stdout is data and gets piped.
- Exit codes: `0` success, `1` bad input data, `2` usage error.
- No third-party runtime dependencies. Standard library only.

## Commits and PRs

- Small commits, one logical change each, message referencing the issue: `sort: handle
  unsorted chrom order (#3)`.
- Branch per issue: `feat/3-sort`.
- PRs go to **your own fork** — see the fork rule at the top of this file.
